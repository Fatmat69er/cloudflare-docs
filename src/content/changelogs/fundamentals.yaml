    title: Dashboard SCIM is now fully self-serve
    description: |-
      Dashboard SCIM is now self-serve. Previously, users configuring SCIM required assistance from Cloudflare to configure SCIM to onboard users. Now, with account owned tokens, SCIM can be configured by Enterprise customers that use Okta or Microsoft Entra without any assistance from Cloudflare.

      Refer to the [SCIM documentation](/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/scim-setup/) for more details.

    title: Account owned tokens
    description: |-
      Account owned tokens are now generally available. Unlike user-owned tokens, account owned tokens are tied with the Cloudflare account instead of the user that created them. This ensures that long term integrations like CI/CD are not broken if the user that set it up leaves your organization.

      Refer to the [Account owned tokens documentation](/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/) or the [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/account-owned-tokens-automated-actions-zaraz/) for more details.
